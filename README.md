### [online-ml](https://online-ml.herokuapp.com/)
## Project for machine learning automation in the browser in python. Given an input in csv format, will do features selection and basic engineering and pick the best model in a list of models 
*disclaimer the no free lunch algorithm stioll applies, generic modeling like this one may not apply to all use cases especially the most subtle ones*

### Features selection
- [x] remove unique features
- [x] remove proper nouns
- [x] remove features that are linear to each others
- [x] remove index
### Features engineering
- [x] remove outliers
- [x] treat NaN
- [x] data encoding
- [x] scale data
### Use cases
- [x] Classification
- [x] Regression
- [ ] NLP
- [ ] Time series analysis
- [ ] Anomaly detection
